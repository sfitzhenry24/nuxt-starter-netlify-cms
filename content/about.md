title: Who is Tami Fitzhenry
---

### Designing since birth

Growing up in a small town in Western PA, Tami honed her craft out of passion for upcycling, creating, decorating, and necessity. Always utilitarian in nature, the question was how can this be functional using the resources available, solid design elements, and with an added flair to express personal style.

### She's Back!

Fast forward after a chemical engineering degree, a marriage, three boys, and 30 years in Supply Chain for a specialty chemical company in Memphis, TN, and Tami is once again focusing on her creative passion. After recently completing an Interior Design certification built on her vast portfolio of decorating projects, she is pleased to offer collaborative interior design to the Memphis, TN and Buffalo, NY areas.

### Sustainable design

Sustainable designing is styling places in sustainable ways focused on leveraging pieces already in the space. While Tami also excels at designing full spaces from scratch, she takes pride in being able to use existing decorations in the home.
