  T. Fitz Design is the ultimate spot for style lovers who want to improve their home decoration without breaking the bank. One of Tami's core philosphies is avoiding waste - many "junk" items are simply a good sanding and paint job away from becoming mainstay pieces of a room.

        Style comes in all colors, shapes, sizes, textures, designs and budgets! I am committed to inclusivity on a personal level, as you should feel in control of the decorative process for your space. I love hearing your ideas first and using those to springboard our discussion. As a proud Maxxinista, I always look for ways to save within the design process because it shouldn't take a large budget to live in a chic space.

        Collaborative Interior Design - The collaborative aspect is KEY to what I do that is different than a designer just going in with a blank slate and big budget. I want the space to feel like your space and will do everything I can to get you there.

    #     Love a great cup of coffee, but never knew how to make one? Bought a
    #     fancy new Chemex but have no clue how to use it? Don't worry, we’re here
    #     to help. You can schedule a custom 1-on-1 consultation with our baristas
    #     to learn anything you want to know about coffee roasting and brewing.
    #     Email us or call the store for details.

    #     We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
    #     That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
    #     space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
    #     coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
    #     sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
